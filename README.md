# Screenshare to your Nintendo DS [WIP]

I found that the DS had Wi-Fi support and my inital thought as a programming challange was to try to create this project at a very early stage i found out that obviously someone had done this before but yet i wanted to improve the ways.

**dbeef**'s implementation has the DS be the server while mine is reversed, the DS is the client connecting to the server.

## Tasks:
- Initial connection [X]
- Sending and reciving [X]
- Implement diff-checker, send only updated pixels [X]
- LZ78 compression(?) [ ]
